# Markdown Widget Challenge

A "live" markdown preview widget in JavaScript using Object Oriented JavaScript. 
Assignment from Phase 3 Dev Bootcamp.

## Usage
When a user enters Markdown *text* inside a text area, the _rendered_ version
is displayed elsewhere on the page.

The text is translated as you type, listening for the 'keyup' event.

Supports `*`, `_`, and `**` for italics, italics,
and bold, respectively.
